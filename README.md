## Overview

Online study room, live-streamed on YouTube 24/7!
The world's first fully automated online entry/exit system (unlimited number of people) using YouTube live streaming & chat (24 hours) .

Viewers can freely enter and exit the room by sending simple commands in the live chat.

Despite the title "study space," various tasks other than studying (walking, yoga, napping, meditation, games, cleaning, etc.) can be done here.

Please see `docs/system-setup.md` for the system setup instructions.
